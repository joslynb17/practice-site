            <span class="bold spanTagFun">She's got a smile that it seems to me</span>
            <br/>
            Reminds me of childhood memories
            Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
            Now and then when I see her face
            She takes me away to that special place
            And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry
            Whoa, oh, oh
            Sweet child o' mine
            Whoa, oh, oh, oh
            Sweet love of mine
            She's got eyes of the bluest skies
            As if they thought of rain
            I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
            Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
            Where as a child I'd hide
            And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
            Whoa, oh, oh
            Sweet child o' mine
            Whoa whoa, oh, oh, oh
            Sweet love of mine
            Whoa, yeah
            Whoa, oh, oh, oh
            Sweet child o' mine
            Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
            Sweet love of mine
            Whoa, oh, oh, oh
            Sweet child o' mine
            Ooh, yeah
            Ooh, sweet love of mine
            Where do we go?
            Where do we go now?
            Where do we go?
            Ooh, oh, where do we go?
            Where do we go now?
            Oh, where do we go now?
            Where do we go? (Sweet child)
            Where do we go now?
            Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
            Where do we go now?
            Ah, ah
            Where do we go?
            Oh, where do we go now?
            Oh, where do we go?
            Oh, where do we go now?
            Where do we go?
            Oh, where do we go now?
            Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
            Sweet child
            Sweet child of mine
